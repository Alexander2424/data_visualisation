Similar to the _world_gdp.py_ file in the _world_gdp_ folder, the _world_population.py_ file generates the interactive _world_population.svg_ image that displays a world map with countries shaded and grouped by their population. The _country_codes.py_ file corrects some data issues in the source data imported from _pygal.maps.world_ _COUNTRIES_ so that all countries can be included in the world map image generated.
